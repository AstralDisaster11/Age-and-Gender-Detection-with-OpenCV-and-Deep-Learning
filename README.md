# Age-and-Gender-Detection-with-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning

This project implements an age and gender detection model using OpenCV's Deep Neural Network (DNN) module. The model takes an image as input and predicts the gender and approximate age of the individuals in the image using pre-trained deep learning models.

# Features
Detects faces in an image using a pre-trained face detection model.
Predicts the gender and age range of each detected face.
Displays the predicted age and gender on the image.
Can be easily adapted to take images as input from various sources such as videos or webcams.

# Pre-trained Models
This project uses the following pre-trained models for age and gender prediction:
Face Detection Model: A deep learning-based face detector from OpenCV.
Age Prediction Model: A pre-trained Caffe model that predicts the age of a detected face.
Gender Prediction Model: A pre-trained Caffe model that predicts the gender of a detected face.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Google Colab (optional)

# How the Model Works
Face Detection: The script uses the pre-trained face detector to identify faces in the input image.
Age and Gender Prediction: For each detected face, the model uses the pre-trained Caffe models to predict:
Age: One of 8 possible age ranges, including (0-2), (4-6), (8-12), etc.
Gender: Either Male or Female.
Bounding Box and Labeling: Each face is surrounded by a bounding box, and the predicted age and gender are displayed on the image.
